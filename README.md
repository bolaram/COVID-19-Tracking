# COVID-19-Tracking
This COVID-19 graph plots the number of new confirmed cases in the past week, versus the total number of confirmed cases.  When plotted in this way, exponential growth is displayed as a straight line.  Notice that most countries follow a similar straight line path, indicating that the growth rate is similar across countries. We're all in this together.
